<p>If you want to achieve more accurate outlines, you can do it with a software image processing. Details must be saved in a format supporting transparency: png or gif.
           <br>         To import details, go to the tab "Create the details" and click on the button "IMG +" located below the list of details. Then manage your imported detail as normal detail using details functions. Moreover, you can move these details in your image by selecting and dragging them with your mouse.           
          </p>         
          
<p class="attention">We recommend that you achieve your details by clearing unused image portions without cropping the original image. The details will have the same dimensions as the background but will be transparent on most part of their surface.<br>
          Thus, you spare yourself the job of having to reposition your details on its exact location in frame.

<p>You can choose a detail, either zoomable or not by ticking / unticking the "Detail zoomable" located below the list of details. A magnifying glass icon appears in front of the titles of the zoomable details.           
          </p>

<p class="attention">A detail will never be zoomed beyond its own definition which would give a pixelated appearance.<br>
          Therefore, if your image is not big enough, turn off the zoom on the details: it would have no effect or could even reduce the size of the detail instead of zooming it !

<h3 id="Utilisation en mode Tablette numerique">Digital tablet mode using</h3>
    
<p>The image active appearance in the digital tablet mode is different because the uses are different. The image active is adapted to a touch use, there is therefore no Mouse over of details. A finger touch selects the detail, the second one starts zooming if the detail is zoomable and a third one deselects detail.</p>
    
<p>There are two toolbars that you can make come and go at any time by clicking the drop-down menu. These toolbars comprise :
    </p>
    	
<ul>
    		
<li>Top toolbars : the four buttons found in all other modes. Only the button "View all details" adopt a different behavior since it no longer reacts to rollover but remains active until a second touch or selecting a detail put it off. If the title you chose is too long, the scrolling arrows
appear to scroll the text.
    		</li>
    		
<li>Bottom toolbars : several buttons numbered according to the number of your details. You can navigate to a detail without going through the image. You choose the order details from the list of details. See <a href="#detourer-details">Cutout details</a>
    		
</li>
    	
</ul>
    
<p>The modifiable parameters to customize this mode are reduced to accommodate the largest number of devices. The modifiable parameters are :
    </p>
    	
<ul> 
    		
<li>Blur (Settings / Select / Blur): choice of the blurring of the rest of the image (color and transparency) while selecting and zooming in and displaying all the details.
    		</li> 
    		
<li>Zoom (Settings / Zoom / Blur): choice of the blurring of the rest of the image (color and transparency) during zooming, adjusting the zoom speed (this function can not be guaranteed because it depends on the performance of the display device).

<h2 id="parametres-de-publication">8. Publication Settings</h2>
<p>When you click on the "Generate interactive animation" button (shortened to ctrl + enter), you are asked to choose the name and location of a file with the extension .swf.                                                              
          </p>
<p>This file is a small standalone application in Flash format that contains all the contents (images, texts, sounds) that you created and add to them interactivity.                                                             
          </p>
<p>This is a compilation step (transformation of a set of resources such as computer code, images or sounds into an application).                                 
          </p>
<p>The advantage of this step is that once your image active compiled, you can be sure it will look and behave the same way regardless of the computer and the user's browser.                                                          
          </p>
<p>A swf file can not be changed by the user even when using the Images Actives software. To change an image active, you need the source file (the xia file).

<h3 id="dimensions-animation">Dimensions of the animation</h3>                                                                      
          
<p>Even if it can be zoomed in a web browser, flash animation features, like a digital image, a specific dimension (width - height). Once the swf file created, its dimensions are determined. To modify them, the swf file must generated again.

<p>By clicking on the "Image" tab, you access a control that allows you to set the image active dimensions. It's not just the width and height of the image area but the size of all the flash animation, including its margins, text fields (title, accordion), the toolbar, the metadata panel.

<figure>			                                       
            
<img src="views/menu_dimensions_standard.png" alt="Le menu des dimensions">

</figure>  		                                   
          
<p>The menu offers a set of predefined dimensions corresponding to most common screen resolutions. If your image active is intended to be used in full screen mode, and if you know the screen resolution (for example, the one of your interactive whiteboard, or the one of a tablet used by your students), you have an interest to choose an entry from this menu.		                                              
          </p>   		                                   
          
<p>You can also set arbitrary dimensions by changing the field "width" and "height". If you want to insert the active image in a model of a web page, this solution is appropriate. 		                                              
          </p>   		                                   
          
<p>The most appropriate choice is to tick the "optimized dimensions". When you modify a dimension (width or height), the other dimension will be recalculated so that the margins of your image active are harmonious and that there is no empty space left.

<p>When the user connects to a web page containing an image active, it is not available right now : it must first be loaded from the server. More the image active contains heavy files resources (images, sounds), the longer time the load will last (particular case, if you does not carry the resources, see below :                                        
            <a href="#embarquement_ou_chargement">Web Publication : boarding or loading resources</a>).

<p>To simplify the posting of your animations, when you create a swf file,  Images Actives generates an "envelope" with a web animation preload. This animation will start automatically until the swf file is fully loaded, and then disappear. This will allow the user to understand that he must wait until the full load of the resource. 			                                 
          </p>			                                 
          
<p>For a standard publication on the web, check the boxes "Disable preloading for use in local" and "Do not embed images and sounds in the animation" are not ticked. So, your animation will consist of a swf file containing all its images and its possible sounds.

<p>                                           In this case, the mechanism of pre-loading standard (see                                        
            <a href="#animation_prechargement">above</a>)  is not appropriate. Indeed, the standard pre-loading animation may run for a long time and the user will be wondering if he is not dealing with a bug.                                                    
          </p>  			                                 
          
<p>Fortunately, Images Active offers a second  preload mechanism, complementary to the first: to enable it, simply tick the box "Do not embed images and sounds in the animation" in the panel "Settings".

<p>So your swf file will be of much lower weight. The animation of preloading will last a short time. When the swf file is loaded, you will see a progress bar informing you of the progress of loading for each image and sound.

<p>When you post your image active as a swf file, users may not know which software to use to view it. If they double-click on the file, they could open it in an application that is not suitable as a video player. If they open a browser, it may not have a Flash player. Moreover, when the swf file is opened directly in a browser, without being wrapped in an HTML page, the screen button will not work.

<p>For these reasons, you may better convert your swf file as a projection. A projection is a standalone application with extensions specific to the operating system (".exe" on Windows, ".app" on Mac).
