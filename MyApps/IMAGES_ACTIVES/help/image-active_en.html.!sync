    <h3 id="Utilisation en mode Tablette numerique">Digital tablet mode using</h3>
    <p>The image active appearance in the digital tablet mode is different because the uses are different. The image active is adapted to a touch use, there is therefore no Mouse over of details. A finger touch selects the detail, the second one starts zooming if the detail is zoomable and a third one deselects detail.</p>
    <p>There are two toolbars that you can make come and go at any time by clicking the drop-down menu. These toolbars comprise :
    </p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Top toolbars : the four buttons found in all other modes. Only the button "View all details" adopt a different behavior since it no longer reacts to rollover but remains active until a second touch or selecting a detail put it off. If the title you chose is too long, the scrolling arrows
appear to scroll the text.
    		</li>
    		<li>Bottom toolbars : several buttons numbered according to the number of your details. You can navigate to a detail without going through the image. You choose the order details from the list of details. See <a href="#detourer-details">Cutout details</a>
    		</li>
    	</ul>
    <p>The modifiable parameters to customize this mode are reduced to accommodate the largest number of devices. The modifiable parameters are :
    </p>
    	<ul> 
    		<li>Blur (Settings / Select / Blur): choice of the blurring of the rest of the image (color and transparency) while selecting and zooming in and displaying all the details.
    		</li> 
    		<li>Zoom (Settings / Zoom / Blur): choice of the blurring of the rest of the image (color and transparency) during zooming, adjusting the zoom speed (this function can not be guaranteed because it depends on the performance of the display device).
    		</li>
    	</ul>                 
    </li>

    <h3 id="utilisation-quiz">Quiz mode using</h3>                                              
    <p>Quiz mode exists for all modes : Accordion, Bubbles, Buttons and Audio.

      <li>When the quiz is locked, the first click on a detail makes the first question appear, and as well a field where to enter the unlock code (specified when creating the questions / answers).
