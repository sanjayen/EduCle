          <p>If you want to achieve more accurate outlines, you can do it with a software image processing. Details must be saved in a format supporting transparency: png or gif.
           <br />         To import details, go to the tab "Create the details" and click on the button "IMG +" located below the list of details. Then manage your imported detail as normal detail using details functions. Moreover, you can move these details in your image by selecting and dragging them with your mouse.           
          </p>         
          <p class="attention">We recommend that you achieve your details by clearing unused image portions without cropping the original image. The details will have the same dimensions as the background but will be transparent on most part of their surface.<br/>
          Thus, you spare yourself the job of having to reposition your details on its exact location in frame.                         
          </p>

          <h3 id="gestion-zoom">Zoom management </h3>                                     
          <p>You can choose a detail, either zoomable or not by ticking / unticking the "Detail zoomable" located below the list of details. A magnifying glass icon appears in front of the titles of the zoomable details.

</figure>      
<p class="attention">A detail will never be zoomed beyond its own definition which would give a pixelated appearance.<br/>
          Therefore, if your image is not big enough, turn off the zoom on the details: it would have no effect or could even reduce the size of the detail instead of zooming it !                         
          </p>

          <h3 id="puces">Use of chips</h3>                                     
          <p>The chips allow you to provide additional information that may not be associated with a specific detail. The chips are below the list of details. You can put in place as many chips as you like. Choose best suited chips for your image and then move them in the picture.
           <br />         The chips are not zoomable but you can order them as you want and combine comments.

<p class="attention">When in mode "buttons" or "accordion", the chips are not visible but they give birth to a button or an additional accordion panel which is not linked to any detail of the image.
