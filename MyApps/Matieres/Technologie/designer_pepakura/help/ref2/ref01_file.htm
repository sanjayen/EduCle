					* You can also open a file by dragging and dropping it on Pepakura Designer's 
					window.<br>
					If the extension is not PDO, 6kt or MQO, a wizard dialog for adjusting

				<th>Reload 3D Model</th>
				<td class="menuitem">This command is used when the source model is modified.<br>
				Pepakura Designer reloads the source model and updates the 2d pattern according to the modification. You can continue editing the 2d pattern even if the source model was changed.

					Import PDO File</th>

					<br>
					You have to take care for the following things.
					<br>
					If the current object is unfolded, the imported file also has to be unfolded. 
					If the current object is not unfolded, the imported file has not to be unfolded 
					seperately.
					<br>
					The size of the 3D model and its position depends on the size and the original 
					position of it in the original 3D CG software. ( Pepakura Designer can not 
					scale and relocate 3D models, so you have to adjust these in the 3D CG 
					software.)
					<br>
					Configurations such as the line style and the margin size are used from the 
					current PDO file.

					If you save a file in this format, its data cannot be edited in Pepakura 
					Designer without a password; this prevents your published data from being 
					altered.
					<br>
					You set the password for editing it later whilst saving the file.
