		</DIV>
		<H2>Image layout</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			You can place jpeg or bmp images on the 2D pattern. The images can be placed 
			under or over developments. The depth order can be changed by right clicking. 
			The size is adjusted by dragging one of the corners. When the [Ctrl] key is 
			pressed, the aspect ratio of the image is maintained.
		</DIV>
		<H2>Multiple parts selection</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			Multiple parts can be selected by specifying a select area. The area is 
			specified by a mouse click and drag. This area selection can be used in [Color 
			Edges] mode for selecting multiple edges at a time.

		Or you can select multiple parts by clicking the parts by pressing the [Shift] 
		key.
