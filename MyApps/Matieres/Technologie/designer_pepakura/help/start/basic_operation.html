			<p>
			Pepakura Designer is mainly operated by your mouse. A mouse with a wheel 
			enables easier operation of the software. If your mouse doesn't have a wheel, a 
			combination of keyboard and mouse allows you the same operation as a mouse with 
			a wheel.
			<p>
				The functions on the screens of the 3D model window and 2D pattern window are 
				as follows. Learn them in order to work smoothly and efficiently. Since this 
				description of the operations is shown on the status bar, it will be helpful to 
				you.
