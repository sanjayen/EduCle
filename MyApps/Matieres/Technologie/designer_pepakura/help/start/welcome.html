		<H1>Introduction</H1>
		<H2>Welcome to the wolrd of Pepakura Designer!</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			Thank you very much for choosing Pepakura Designer 3.<br>
			Pepakura Designer is a program developed in Japan (the word <I>Pepakura</I> stands 
			for <I>papercraft</I> in Japanese) for making unfolded 2D patterns from the 3D 
			models. Because the operation is very simple, you 
			can make patterns easily. Then you can edit the pattern as you like.<br>
			<br>
			Pepakura Designer makes it easy to design original papercraft patterns by 
			importing 3D model data. No special knowledge is required for making papercraft 
			patterns. All you have to do is prepare the 3D model. You may use some 3DCG 
			software released from other developers to make the 3D models for unfolding.
			<br>
			<br>
			Not only can a pattern created by Pepakura Designer be printed and saved as 2D 
			image, but you can also share it with other people. The dedicated viewer, 
			Pepakura Viewer, is available from Pepakura Designer's official web site 
			freely.<br>
			<br>
			Now you can enjoy designing your own papercraft. The 3D models that you 
			design with 3D CG software, can be put out into the real world from the 
			digital world using Pepakura Designer.<br>
			<br>
			Welcome to the world of Pepakura Designer!
