		<DIV class="main" id="DIV1">
			<p>Pepakura Designer's simple work flow is shown here. The main functions are 
				Opening a model, Unfolding, Printing and Saving the file.
			</p>
		</DIV>
		<H2>1. Loading 3D model data</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			Pepakura Designer is made to open 3D model data and to unfold the 3D models. To 
			make this easy the target 3D model should be prepared before hand to have as few 
			faces as possible. The 3D model can be designed with other 3DCG software, such as 
			Maya, 3DMAX, Wavefront, Metasequoia.
			<br>
			<br>
			The following example is using the file [color_cube.mqo] as an example. The 
			file is included with Pepakura Designer in the [samples] folder.
			<br>
			<br>
			Firstly select a file by selecting [File]-[Open] in the menu, or drag and drop 
			a file into Pepakura Designer's main application window. (*.mqo is 
			Metasequoia's file extension)

		<H2>2. Setting sheet size
		</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			Most of the popular printers use A4 sized paper as default; and Pepakura 
			Designer is set to print on A4 paper, this is an initial setting.
			<br>
			If you want to use other paper sizes, please set the sizes in both of the 
			following settings which are found under, [File]-[Print Setup] (physical size) 
			and [File]-[Print and Paper Configurations] (Pepakura Designer's setting).
		</DIV>
		<H2>3. Unfolding</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			To unfold a 3D model, press the [Unfold] button on toolbar. (Check the [Auto] 
			checkbox before clicking the Unfold button for an easy unfolding)
			<br>
			<br>
			<center>
				<img src="image/cpt02-04_02.png"><br>
				Unfold button
			</center>
			<br>
			Pepakura Designer will now display the unfolded 2D pattern.
			<br>
			<br>
			<center>
				<img src="image/cpt02-04_03.png"><br>
				As you can see, the box was unfolded
			</center>
		</DIV>
		<H2>4. Printing</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			To print select [File]-[Print]. Depending on your needs, you may need to change 
			the settings in the [File]-[Printer Setup] window.
			<br>
			(* For setting up your printer, please see its official manual from its 
			creator)
		</DIV>
		<H2>5. Saving
		</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			To save the unfolding, select [File]-[Save As] and save the unfolding to a 
			file. The default file name is [color_cube.pdo]. You can change this name to 
			whatever you like.
			<br>
			(* .pdo is Pepakura Designer's file extension)
			<br>
			<br>
			This is Pepakura Designer's basic workflow.
