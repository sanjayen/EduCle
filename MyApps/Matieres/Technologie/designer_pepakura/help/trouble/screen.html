		<H1>Problem of Screen Display</H1>
		<H2>There might be something wrong with the display, such as the window turning 
			black.</H2>
		<DIV class="main">
			<p>
			There might also be problems such as a display failure, or the application 
			might freeze because of incompatibility with your version of Opengl32.dll and 
			your video card. In that case, make sure that a new driver is available from 
			the video card's vendor. Problems may be resolved by updating your video card 
			driver.
			<p>If a problem still persists, try the following measures:
				<br>
				1. Right-click on a blank part of your desktop, and select [Property].<br>
				2. Select [Details] of [Setting] tab.<br>
				3. Reduce the level of [Hardware Acceleration] on the [Troubleshooting] tab.<br>
				<br>
				(The above steps may differ according to your version of Windows.)<br>
			<p>
			Similar adjustments may be made by [Start]-[Control 
			Panel]-[System]-[Performance]-[Graphics].
