If you are still having problems, try a new battery in the tower or a different port.WRONG TOWER RESPONSE (%d bytes read on port %d): ROBOLAB got an incorrect response from your tower - check that the green light turns on when you hit "try again" - make sure that the cable is well connected. This error is usually a result of a bad cable connection (some garbled information is returned to the computer).  Set the switch on the bottom of the tower to Low. If you are still having problems, try a new battery in the tower, a new cable, or a different port.CHECKSUM ERROR (%d bytes read on port %d): ROBOLAB got an error in the RCX reply.  Try transmitting again (hit "try again" a few times).  If that is still not working - try turning the RCX off and on again.  This can also happen because there is too much light in the room, try blocking or reducing the background lighting.  If you are still having problems, try replacing the batteries in the RCX.CHECKSUM ERROR (%d bytes read on port %d): ROBOLAB got an error in the RCX reply.

Check to make sure it is on and that it has fresh batteries.  Try transmitting again (hit "try again" a few times).  If that is still not working - try turning the RCX off and on again.

Check to make sure it is on and that it has fresh batteries.  Try transmitting again (hit "try again" a few times).  If that is still not working - try turning the RCX off and on again.  Try switching the tower to Low power (switch at bottom of tower). This can also happen because there is too much light in the room, try blocking or reducing the background lighting.  If you are still having problems, try replacing the batteries in the RCX..Not usedNUNot usedNUNETWORK ERROR: Robolab cannot find the networked computer at IP %s.  Check and make sure that the remote computer is on and that ROBOLAB is running on it.USB PORT SETUP ERROR: Robolab cannot find the proper USB tower.  Try using Select COM Port to select the proper port.  Or disconnect and reconnect the tower.
