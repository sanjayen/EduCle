% pylote

To draw on the screen and to handle the instruments of geometry there.

Presentation:
============

**pylote** is a software making it possible to draw on the screen of the computer, like handling various instruments of geometry.

It is a software **multiplateforme**, **free** (license GNU GPL), made in **Python** (computer programming language) and **PyQt4** for the graphical interface.


### An image:

![alt text](images/interface.jpeg "Title")

### Principle:

The software functions on a screenshot of the computer.

On this image, one can draw, write and handle instruments of geometry.

One can also charge various backgrounds.

And many other things…


### The toolbox:

![alt text](images/boite_outils.jpeg "Title")

### Use of the instruments:

One moves them with the left mouse button.

The right button makes it possible to rotate them.

The middle button (serrated roller used as button) makes it possible to scale them.

**Whiteboard Mode:** by the toolbox, one can modify the behavior of the left mouse button, which allows a use with a mouse only one button (a stylet with infra-red for example).
All the tools are thus accessible.


### To do :

* a complete and clear help file
 
* a translation of this page, comments of the code and help file (that which is not made yet) in English, because it is necessary to internationalize a software.







### Installation:

#### For Linux:

Python is inevitably already installed. If PyQt4 is not it, it is available in your distribution (for Ubuntu, it is the package “python-qt4”).

#### For Windows:

* **First solution:**

> Sylvain Bignon ([http://cdpmaths.free.fr->http://cdpmaths.free.fr]) which helped me much to improve this program compiles a version installable for Windows. You will find it here:
> [http://cdpmaths.free.fr/pylote/->http://cdpmaths.free.fr/pylote/]

* **Second solution:**

> You will have to initially install [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) by choosing "Python 2.6.1 Windows installer" (or more recent).

> then [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download) by choosing "PyQt-Py2.6-gpl-4.4.4-2.exe" (or more recent) in the "Binary Packages".


#### For Mac:

> It is necessary to install since the same pages as indicated for Windows, and that would interest me to have returns.

#### And then for all:

> It is necessary to decompress the file then to below launch the file “pylote.pyw”.

> It is python, therefore is while clicking above if the files py and pyw are associated with python, that is to say in console:

> > python pylote.pyw
