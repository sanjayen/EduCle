<p class="p1">The Open-Sankoré software uses the native players present by default on the computer to interpre audio, video or flah medias. However, all formats cannot be played in this software if the computer does not have the necessary codecs installed.</p>
<p class="p1">Codecs are small programs that enable to decode the various available audio and video file formats.</p>
<p class="p1">The players used by Open-Sankoré are :</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">Windows Media Player for Windows,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></li>
  <li class="li1">QuickTime Player for Mac,</li>
  <li class="li1">Phonon (an abstraction of gstreamer ou xine) for Linux.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">You should prefer to use the following formats, that should be decoded easily by all systems :</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">images with the formats .png, .svg, .jpg or .gif</li>
  <li class="li1">videos with the formats .mp4 or .flv</li>
  <li class="li1">audios in the .mp3 format</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are a few codec packs that enable you to extend the range of multimedia formats supported by the reader used by Open-Sankoré.</p>
<p class="p1">Be however careful when you install them, particularly with free packs that are supposed to contain codecs of several companies. Some of these packs can create problems or instabilities on your operating system.</p>
<p class="p1">Please refer to the documentation of your operating system and to the online support forum.</p>
