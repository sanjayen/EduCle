<h2>Frame controls</h2>

<p>Cartoon Stories begin with one frame. Frames can be added, deleted, copied and pasted using the frame control buttons. Also use the control buttons to move to the next or previous frame. There is no limit to the number of frames a Cartoon Story can have.</p>

<h2>Image library - people and backgrounds</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td width=200 valign="top">
<p>The Cartoon Story Maker comes with a number of image libraries. Use the arrows below each item to view the various images. Drag and drop the item you want onto the frame. Use the 'Picture tools' (described below) to change the size and rotation of images. </p><br>

</table>
<p><strong>The difference between 'foreground' and 'background' images</strong></p>
<p>'Foreground' images (any of the images from the people libraries) behave differently than images from the background library.
<ul>
<li>You can add an unlimited number of foreground image to a frame.
<li>You can only have one background image on each frame. If you drag a new background image to a frame the previous background will be deleted.
<li>The order of foreground images can be changed. By selecting an image and then clicking on the 'Bring forward' or 'Send behind' controls you can move an image infront of or behind other images on the screen.  
<li>Background images always stay at the back.
<li>You can change the scale and rotation of both foreground and background images
</ul>

<br><hr>
 <a name="3"></a>
 <h2>Picture and text tools</h2>
<p><strong> Picture tools </strong> - enable you to manipulate library images, imported images, backgrounds and text bubbles placed in the frame. You must select an object to manipulate it. Do this by clicking on the image, or if it is a text bubble by clicking on the 'handle' (a blue line will appear around the selected item). Then click on one of the picture tool buttons. </p> 
<p><strong> Text tools </strong> - enable you to format the text in bubbles and information boxes. You must select the text bubble first. Do this by clicking on the 'handle' -  (a blue line will appear around the selected item). The format of the selected text can now be changed by clicking on one of the text tools.</p> 
<img src="images/object_control.gif" ALT="">  
<ul>
<li>Text formatting can only be applied to the whole bubble, not to individual words. 
<li>Audio bubbles cannot be manipulated with object controls.
<li>Text bubbles cannot be rotated or flipped.

</ul>
<br><hr>
<a name="3a"></a>
<h2>Accent Key Panel</h2>
<p><img src="images/accent_button.png" ALT="">&nbsp; &nbsp; This button opens the Accent Key Panel (see below). To insert an accented letter into the text bubble place the cursor in the bubble and then click on the accented character you want. You can move the Accent Key Panel by by clicking and dragging on the blue bar along the top.</p>
<p><img src="images/accent_panel.png" ALT=""></p>
<p><strong>Changing the letters on the Accent Key Panel</strong></p>
<p>You may wish to customise the accented letters which appear in this panel. The letters on the Accent Key Panel are drawn from a file called 'accent_key.txt'.  By changing the letters in this file, you change the letters that appear on the Accent Key Panel. Any Unicode characters can be added to this panel. </p>
<p>This text file is stored in the Cartoon Story Maker program folder. With a typical installation this will be found in 'C:\Program Files\Cartoon Story Maker' (or do a search for 'accent_key.txt').<p>
<p>The Accent Key Panel can hold 57 letters, any additional letters will not appear.  To change the letters:<p>

<ul>
<li>Open 'accent_key.txt'
<li>Delete any unwanted letters and add your own. (You can use the 'Character Map' (found in Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System tools) to find the characters you want. Make sure the font is set to 'Arial'.)
<li>There should be no spaces or carriage returns between the letters.
<li>Save the file. 
</ul>
<p>The new letters will only appear after the Cartoon Story Maker has been restarted.</p>
<br><hr>

<h2>Using Chinese or Japanese characters or non-Roman scripts</h2>
<p>A general rule is: use the same input method to type the script into the Cartoon Story Maker as you would in MS Word. This is done by changing the IME (or input method). This is done through the Regional Setting Control panel. Once a new 'input method' has been added to your system you can select with the 'language bar'. </p>
<p>NOTE: Some languages  (for example Pin Yin and some Cyrillic languages) now use a font rather than an input method to type letters not found in the Roman alphabet. In this case a different font is selected to enter those letters. This will not work in the Cartoons Story maker as the font cannot be changed. Other languages, such as Vietnamese, use Third Party systems to enter certain characters. These systems will not work with the Cartoon Story Maker either.</p>
<p>Ask your IT support for help if you are unsure about setting up the correct input method for your LOTE.</p>

 <h2>Text bubbles</h2>
 <p><strong>Text bubble libraries</strong></p>
 <p><img src="images/text_bubbles_1.gif" ALT=""> </p>
 
 </p>
<p>Use the navigation arrows below each text bubble to view bubble styles and sizes. Once a bubble has been dragged and dropped to the frame you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add your own text by deleting the display text and typing new text
<li>Change the style of bubble by clicking the navigation arrows below each bubble.
<li>Move the bubble by clicking and dragging the 'handle'
<li>Change the size of the bubble by selecting it (by clicking on the drag spot) and then clicking on the 'enlarge' or 'reduce' buttons from the 'picture tools'
<li>Change the formatting of the text by by selecting the bubble and using the 'text tools' to:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - increase or reduce the size of the text inside the bubbles<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - change the text colour<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - make the text in the bubble bold, italised or underlined<br>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Text bubble after it has been dragged onto a frame</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/bubble_controls.png" ALT=""></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>Text formatting can only be applied to the whole bubble, not to individual words. The font cannot be changed.</p>

 <h2>Audio bubbles</h2>
 <img src="images/rec_bubbles.gif" ALT=""> 
<p>You can add voice recordings to a frame. The recordings can be made on the spot using the built-in recorder or you can import pre-recorded  (MP3) sound files. </p>
<ul>
<li>The sound recording can be any length, but it is better to limit it to a sentence or two.
<li>You can add as many sound bubbles to a frame as needed
</ul>
<p>Drag an audio bubble to the frame to insert a recording.</p>

<h3>How to add an existing MP3 sound to a frame:</h3>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td width=300 valign="top">1. Drag an audio bubble onto the screen and click on 'Add Sound'. <br> <br>NOTE: All other tools will now be disabled.</td>

<td width=200 valign="top"><img src="images/select_sound.gif" ALT=""></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=300 valign="top">3. Use the browse window to navigate to an MP3 sound file.  Add the sound by double clicking on it or by selecting it and clicking the 'Save Sound' button. <br><br><strong>NOTE:</strong> Only MP3 sounds can be added. To use sounds saved in other formats use an audio editing program or an online sound converter to change the sound to an MP3 file.</td>
<td width=200 valign="top"><img src="images/sound_browse.gif" ALT=""></td>
</tr>
<td width=300 valign="top">Click on the 'Play' button to hear the sound.<br><br>To change the sound click on the 'Edit Sound' button and repeat the process.</td>

</tr>
</table>

<h3>How to add a new voice recording to a frame:</h3>
<p>Before you can add a voice recording you must plug a microphone into the computer, and make sure the record and play back settings on the computer are set to the appropriate levels. Use the computer's Control Panel to do this.<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td width=300 valign="top">1. Drag an audio bubble onto the screen and click on 'Add Sound'. <br> <br>NOTE: All other tools will now be disabled.</td>
<td width=200 valign="top"><img src="images/add_sound.gif" ALT=""></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=300 valign="top">2. Click on the 'New Recording' button. This opens a simple record panel.</td>
<td width=200 valign="top"><img src="images/select_sound.gif" ALT=""></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=300 valign="top">
<p>Recording your voice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on Record and speak into the microphone. (The Record button turns into the 'Stop' button).
<li>Click on Stop when you have finished. The reorder takes a moment to convert the recording.
<li>Click on 'Play' to listen to the recording. <strong>NOTE: </strong>If unhappy with the recording, click on Record and say the sentence again.
<li>When satisfied with the recording click on 'Save'
</ul>
</td>
<td width=200 valign="top"><img src="images/record_panel.gif" ALT=""></td>
</tr>
<td width=300 valign="top">Click on the 'Play' button to hear the sound.<br><br>To chnage the sound click on the 'Edit Sound' button and repeat the process.</td>
<td width=200 valign="top"><img src="images/snd_bub_play.gif" ALT=""></td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>

<p><strong>Hint: </strong>Recording begins the instant the Record button is clicked, so make sure you have your sentence prepared, and begin speaking straight away 
For clear recordings hold the microphone just below your mouth and speak in clear a loud voice.</p>
<p>If you don't attach a sound to an audio bubble it will automatically be deleted when the story is saved.</p>

 <h2>Importing images</h2>
 <p>You can import your own images into the Cartoon Story Maker. For example you can import digital photos, images from the internet or pictures you have created with another program into the Cartoon Story Maker and include them in your story.</p>
<p>To use an image from the internet you must first save it on computer. When you have found the image you want RIGHT click on the image and select 'Save picture as'. </p>
<p>Once placed on the frame imported images can be manipulated with the picture tools.</p> 
<p>The same general rules apply to imported foreground and imported backgrounds as apply to images from the libraries (see above).  The only difference betweeen imported foregrounds and imported backgrounds is that imported backgound images are resized to fit the frame area.</p>
<p>Only JPEGs, GIFs or PNG images can be imported. Other types of images can easily be converted to one of these formats using a simple image editing program such as Paint or one of the many online image converters (search for  'online image converter ').</p>
<br>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td width="200" valign='top'>

1. Click on the 'Browse' button below the import image or import background viewers. This will open a browse window.

<br>
<p><strong>About image size</strong></p>
<p>JPG images imported into the Cartoon Story Maker are automaically resized to fit the frame. This means that a 6MP digital photo that is 3000 x 2000 pixels (and 2mb) is reduced to 700 x 400 pixels and is only 500kb. However PNGs and GIFs are not resized by the Cartoon Story Maker. If you are importing large images in either of these filetypes it's a good idea resize them in an image editing program first. This will reduce the files size of the finished story.</p>

 <h2>Making the background of an image 'transparent'</h2>
<p>The frame below shows a background image found on the web and imported into the Cartoon Story Maker. A digital photo of a student has been placed in the foreground, as though the student were really there. To achieve this effect, the background of the student's photo has been made 'transparent'. </p> 
  <p><table cellpadding="5"><tr>
  
<td  width="180" valign="top"><img src="images/girl_1.png" ALT=""> <p>1: Take the photo against a plain coloured, evenly lit background with significant contrast to the subject.</td>
<td  width="180" valign="top"><img src="images/girl_2.png" ALT=""> <p>2: Use the 'Magic wand tool' in an image editing program to select and delete the background.</td>
 <td width="345" valign="top"><img src="images/paris.png" ALT=""> <p>3. With the photo of the student having a 'transparent' background it appears that she is standing in front of the Eiffel Tower.</td> 
 </tr>
  </table></p>
  <p>Most image editing programs have a 'Magic wand' feature (for example Photoshop, or 'Paint.net' which can be downloaded free from the internet). </p>
  <p>NOTE: Images with transparent backgrounds can only be saved as PNGs or GIFs</p>

<ul>
<li>Unfinished stories can be saved and then opened again and completed
<li>To save a story you must have at least one item on the first frame
<li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> File names must be in the system font. For example, if your system uses English then don't use other alphabets, Chinese or Japanese characters or even accented letters in the file name.
</ul>
