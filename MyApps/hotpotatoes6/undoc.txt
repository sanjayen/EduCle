This undocumented file lists some other undocumented features of Hot Potatoes.

The following F keys are shortcuts to export functions:
	
	F6: Make a HotPot version 6 exercise.
	Control + F6: Make a HotPot version 6 drag/drop exercise (JMatch and JMix only).
	Shift + F6: Make a JMatch flashcard exercise.
	F11: Do a quick export to a temporary file, and open it in the browser (in JQuiz, the exercise will open directly to the question you're currently editing).
	Control + F11: Do a quick drag-drop export to a temporary file, and open it in the browser (JMatch and JMix only).
	Shift + F11: Do a quick flashcard export to a temporary file, and open it in the browser (JMatch only).

	In the Masher, F11 will build only the currently-selected file in the file list.
	
Control+Shift+Alt+0 (zero) will switch on or off the stripping of comments from inside JavaScript when exporting to create Web pages. Stripping comments can make file sizes a little smaller. This is off by default. Note that only comments beginning with //, from the beginning of the line, will be removed.

In some Hot Potatoes applications, Control+Shift+Alt+R will launch a find-and-replace dialog box. In the translation screen, Control+F will launch a Find dialog box.

Control+Alt+Shift+S will allow you to select a different location for the source files the program will use to create Web pages.

Control+Alt+Shift+T will reset the source file location to the default location (the \source\ folder inside the Hot Potatoes program folder).

In the registration entry dialog box, pressing Alt + Z will fill in your current user name and key.

Starting any Potato with the command-line switch /s will suppress the splash screen.

From the main HotPot window, holding down the Shift key while clicking on a Potato will start it without showing the splash screen.

In the main HotPot window, pressing Control + Alt + Shift + F2 allows you to change the registration information stored by the program (for example, if you want to register using a different name/key combination).

Using the command-line switch /V6, you can automatically run a Hot Potato, passing it the name of a file to open, and the name of a configuration file, an HTML file to export to, the path to source files you want to use, and the "next exercise" URL, and have the program create standard version 6 output then close automatically without showing its screen at all. Here's an example:

	c:\HotPotatoes6\JCloze.exe /V6 c:\MyHotPotFiles\gapfill.jcl c:\MyHotPotFiles\config.cfg c:\MyWebPages\gapfill.htm
c:\HotPotatoes6\source nextexercise.htm /s

This will silently run JCloze, open the file "gapfill.jcl", export it to create a V6 web page called "gapfill.htm", then exit without even showing its splash screen (the final /s suppresses the splash screen). You can use this functionality to build batch files which export whole sets of HotPot files automatically. The configuration file can be an empty file, if you want to use the configuration which is in the data file already. Don't forget to add quotes around any paths which have spaces in them. If your exercise, or your configuration file, have the Next Exercise button turned off, then the value for the next exercise URL will be ignored. The Masher is a simpler way to do all this, though.

In JQuiz, pressing Control+Alt+Shift+7 will add "&nbsp;" to the beginning and end of every answer. Pressing Control+Alt+Shift+8 will remove leading and trailing "&nbsp;" strings. This is useful if you're working with a right-to-left language in a left-to-right environment, because adding these leading and trailing strings will prevent the answer text from being justified to the right, away from the answer buttons, in the output.

Pressing Control+Shift+Z will insert the following code into the current textbox:
	<div style="display: none;" class="HiddenReading"></div>
If any text is selected at the time of pressing the keys, it will be enclosed in the div. This is only useful in the Question field of JQuiz. Anything enclosed within this div will be shown in the reading text div when the question is displayed, enabling you to provide individual reading texts for each question. If you are using this, please note that the Show All Questions button will be hidden as soon as such a reading text is displayed, to avoid confusion, and don't forget to check the checkbox on the Reading Text screen to include a reading, otherwise there will be no reading text box in which to show the text.

In JCross, when using the automatic grid maker, you can now type "word::clue" to include clues for your words automatically.
