 1. What is HOT POTATOES?

HOT POTATOES is a suite of six programs for creating interactive educational exercises for the World Wide Web. These are the programs included, along with the types of exercise they create:

 JQuiz: multiple-choice, true-false,
           text-entry or short-answer 
           quizzes
 JCloze: gap-fill exercises
 JCross: crosswords
 JMix: jumbled-sentence exercises
 JMatch: matching and ordering 
         exercises
 The Masher: a tool for creating 
             complete units of exercises.

All of the exercises use JavaScript and HTML for their functionality. 

The version 6 output pages are fully XHTML 1.1-compliant, and can be automatically uploaded to the www.hotpotatoes.net hosting service. THE hotpotatoes.net HOSTING SERVICE IS NOT FREE; IT IS A COMMERCIAL SERVICE PROVIDED BY A SEPARATE COMPANY.

You do not need to know JavaScript or HTML in order to use these programs -- all you need to do is to enter your 
data (questions, answers etc.) and press a button, and the programs will create Web pages for you automatically. 
It couldn't be easier!

HOT POTATOES was created by: 

 Stewart Arneil (Mac and Web programming)
 Martin Holmes (Windows and Web programming)
 Hilary Street (Graphics).
